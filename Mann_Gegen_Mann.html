                Thats a song by the German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, released in March 2006 as the third and final single from the band's fifth studio album, Rosenrot. The song's narrative portrays a man with strong homosexual desires, and it is the first Rammstein music video to feature nudity since the video for their cover of Depeche Mode's "Stripped".

                The text, which deals with the subject of homosexuality in terms of content, remains largely ambiguous in its message, dealing with both homophilia and homophobia. This is quite intentional, as Paul Landers and Oliver Riedel explained in an interview:
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>
We definitely didn't intend to write a gay anthem. 
Of course it is a critical topic how a heterosexual 
person deals with the topic of a homosexual person.
Maybe we can contribute to defusing the word 'gay'
a bit and relativise the negative touch.

                This ambiguity is achieved through artificial elements consisting of complex but open-ended linguistic images and allusions, for example: Ich nehm mein Schicksal in die Hand/Mein Verlangen ist bemannt ("I take my fate into my own hands/My desire is manned") or In meiner Kette fehlt kein Glied/Wenn die Lust von hinten zieht ("In my chain no link is missing/When lust pulls from behind"). In the further lyrics of the song, homophobia is also made an issue several times. Negative views of homosexuality are also presented in three two-liners: Mein Geschlecht schimpft mich Verräter/Ich bin der Alptraum aller Väter ("My gender calls me traitor/I am the nightmare of all fathers"). In between, the negatively connoted German exclamation Schwuler! ("Gay!") also occurs.

                In the process, the first four stanzas create a quasi-homosexual utopia with partly subtle but also relatively clear allusions. Thus "little prince" is a symbol for the penis, but also for the object of desire in contrast to the queen. At the same time, it is an allusion to The Little Prince (1943), a novella written by the French aristocrat Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Rammstein singer Till Lindemann uses a deliberately soft singing style that differs from his otherwise masculine singing voice. The chorus, which is much more expressive and aggressive, uses everyday language, including the phrase Gleich und gleich gesellt sich gern ("Birds of a feather flock together").

            <p>
                Christian Diemer, musicologist and Germanist, subjected both the music video and the lyrics to a deeper hermeneutic examination, and came to the following conclusion:
            </p>
            <p>
                The text-based findings indicate that contrary expressions of opinion of varying degrees of explicitness and diffuseness are staged, partly in clearly assigned textual elements, partly on the micro-level of ambiguity and metaphors. (...) There are widely varying degrees of concreteness and diffuseness on the one hand and of affirmation and rejection on the other.

                    — Christian Diemer[1]

                The music video, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, premiered on MTV Germany on 2 February 2006. It shows the band members performing on a dark stage while almost entirely naked, aside from frontman Till Lindemann, who wears long black hair extensions, thigh-high feminine high-heeled boots, and a set of black latex briefs. The rest of the band members wear only black army boots, with their instruments covering their genitals. The video alternates between the band playing and scenes of a writhing group of naked, muscular, oiled men on the same dark stage. It starts to rain on the band during the bridge of the song, and a frenzied Lindemann screams as a forked tongue flicks from his mouth. The tempo of the song then changes to a melodic pace as the band members then crowd-surf over the oiled and naked men. Lindemann becomes a kind of winged demon, with the hands and arms of naked men reaching up towards him and worshipping him; the song's tempo changes back to its frenzied pace. The group of men with the band members begin to wrestle and fight with one another as it rains on them. Screaming again, Lindemann starts to rip his hair out as the song closes.

                Destiny smiled on me
                and gave me a present
                Threw me on a warm star
                So close to the skin, so far from the eye
                I take my destiny in my own hands
                My desire is manned

                Where the fresh water dies
                because it taints itself in salt
                I keep the Little Prince in mind
                A king without a queen
                When a woman is mistaken about me
                then the bright world is confused

                Man against man
                My skin belongs to the gentlemen
                Man against man
                Birds of a feather flock together
                Man against man
                I am the servant of two masters
                Man against man
                Birds of a feather flock together

                I am the corner of all rooms
                I am the shadow of all trees
                No link is missing in my chain
                when lust pulls from behind
                My sex calls me a traitor
                I am the nightmare of all fathers

                Man against man
                My skin belongs to the gentlemen
                Man against man
                Birds of a feather flock together

                Man against man
                But my heart freezes on some days
                Man against man
                Cold tongues that beat there

                Faggot! 

                I'm not interested in balance
                The sun shines in my face
                But my heart freezes on some days
                Cold tongues that beat there

                Faggot!
                Man gay for man

                The song is about homophobia from a gay man's piont of view. Obviously it's anti-homophobic. Rammstein are not gay or at least not open about it if they are (being married and having children doesn't mean you're straight, sexuality is far more complex thing than just homo/hetero), but they are definitely gay-friendly. Till Lindemann, who has lots of gay friends and often hangs out in gay bars (he was seen here in Berlin many times), would never write a homophobic song. Sorry for my English, BTW, I'm German.

                I reckon its really simple.
                It's about how most straight men think about gay men
                In the lyrics "my gender calls me a traitor" meaning straight men don't like gays. 
                They are something that is wrong.
                "Bird of feather flock together" Meaning how the gays all stay together.
                "My skin belongs to the gentlemen" Literally means your gay

I especially like some of the lines:

'I am the corner of all rooms.
I am the shadow of all trees.'
Means - homosexuals must hide themselves 
from society because they're not accepted.

'there is no limb missing in my chain
I am not interested in balance'
Which means: homosexuals maybe are defection of the 
nature,but they have been since ages, which means that
we need to accept them for who they are, and that they
aren't interested in reduced birth rate, and, in fact 
they will always be in society in some number.

'The sun shines in my face'
Either that they are really happy who they are (since 
warm sun on face is a positive feeling), or that they 
have it tougher than other people. (since sun in the
face blinds)

'But my heart frozes in some times, cold tongues
that beat there'
Obviously that they feel offensed when being called names.
