            <h2>The Story Behind The Song: Rammstein’s Ausländer</h2>
            <p>A dig at sex tourists? A takedown of colonialism? Or just the ultimate Eurotrash industrial metal song? We unpack Rammstein’s mischievous 2019 single Ausländer</p>
            <p>Rammstein didn’t get to the top of the heavy metal doggy-pile by being nice boys singing nice songs. The Berlin six-piece have pushed, humped (ouch) and often set fire to the envelope since forming in 1994, and naturally pissed off a fair few folk along the way. Ausländer, released 25 years after their formation, proved that a bunch of middle-aged men playing industrial metal still had the wit and want to wind people up – including high-ranking members of the Russian government. </p>
            <p>Ausländer arrived in the middle of Rammstein fever. After their previous record, 2009’s Liebe Ist Für Alle Da, nearly broke the band up; after guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe had teased that whatever they released next might be the last thing they ever put to tape; after a decade of excruciating will-they, won’t-they to-and-fro, Rammstein were back with a seventh, untitled album.</p>

            </a>


            <p>The first single, Deutschland, caused its fair share of controversy when it dropped in March 2019: having your band members dress up as holocaust victims in a music video will do that, even if the pathos driving the song was bang on the money. Radio came next, examining the censorship of Western music, art and culture by the German Democratic Republic – something the members of Rammstein lived through behind the Berlin Wall.</p>
            <p>            All heavy, horrid stuff – and that’s just the first two songs on the record. When the album was finally released on May 17, 2019, that couplet was followed up by Zeig Dich, which effectively calls out paedophiles within the Catholic Church. Elsewhere, you’ve got vocalist Till Lindemann singing about murder, rape, stalkers and heartache in that idiosyncratically melancholy way only he can – it’s one of the main factors that set this band apart from other German industrialists like KMFDM and Eisbrecher. The empathy, the sadness, the feels.</p>

            <p>That apparent lack of baggage is what made Ausländer such a red herring. Initially, for us Neanderthal, English-speaking monolinguists, it seemed like a bit of a laugh in the context of the album – on the surface, it was light-hearted. Christian ‘Flake’ Lorenz goes full-on Eurotrash with his hyperactive keyboards and clippetty hand-clap effects, as if Pitbull is mere seconds away from leaping into the chorus and shouting ‘Mr. Worldwide!’; the rhythm section lays down a simplistic, juddering bedrock for Till to fire off brash ‘sleep with me, yeah?’ proclamations in various languages such as Russian, French, Spanish, Italian and – yes, for us at the back! – English.</p>

            <p>At first glance, the song’s about one-night stands. Till’s character travels the world, waxing the local tongue to lure women into bed, despite fudging his German at the end. “Ich bin ausländer” = ‘I am a foreigner’. Till is the ausländer, getting by and getting off with only Duolingo and the libido of a rabbit who’s all out of carrots. So far, so silly. But of course, this is Rammstein. And in typical Rammstein fashion, the ensuing music video opened a whole other can of würste.</p>
