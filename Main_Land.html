            <h2 id="head">The song</h2>
            <p>"Mein Land" (German for "My country") is a song by German Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. It was released as a single from their greatest hits album, Made in Germany 1995–2011, on 11 November 2011 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and internationally on 14 November.[2] The cover art is based on The Beach Boys' Surfer Girl album cover</p>
            <p>
                This is the first single and only previously unreleased track from German Industrial Metal band Rammstein's retrospective, Made in Germany 1995-2011. The English translation of the title is "My Land" and the song is a parodic satire about European xenophobia and Anti-Immigrationists. It was released on November 11, 2011 in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and internationally three days later.

                This is a tough one. It's actually one of my favorite Rammstein songs, specifically in combination with this video.</p>

                <p><a class="btn" href="#lyric">First of all, lyrics with an English translation.</a></p>

                <p>Now, Rammstein do not make one-sided songs. They always have some deeper meaning, be it political, connected to news, a direct criticism of culture, cultural developments or behavior of the media. This is, more or less, a criticism of culture and cultural behavior, which applies not only to Germany.</p>

                <p>We have two different persona's sung by Til Lindemann. One, the 'owner' of the land or state (Land in German can mean both and more), we'll call him Man A, another, a visitor to said land, state or country, let's say Man B. The idea behind it is that Man A doesn't like a stranger (most likely with a different culture or some patriotism toward his own home) coming into his country. I don't need to specify where, in our real world, this applies. Man B isn't accepted anywhere, no one 'invites him to stay', or likes him. All backgrounded by a grunted 'Mein Land!'. So it really is a rather basic song, criticizing richer countries not accepting poorer immigrants, or anything along those lines.</p>

                <p>The whole video was filmed on a beach in Malibu, California in May 2011 and gives off a very 1960s feel. Only until the end of the video the Rammstein of today are portrayed in typical concert attire, industrial/metal/goth style. The video itself is high quality, directed by Jonas Åkerlund. 
                Although incredibly well made, here is my only criticism: The video has no visible connection to what the text portrays. I love the video. I love the music. The Music itself fits together with the images well and the video comes across as a childish, nigh innocent (even more so, if there weren't so many boobs), but the deeper meaning just seems to disappear fully. This might be the reason many die-hard Rammstein fans dislike this song and/or video, along with the fact that Rammstein usually also have some deep, psychological, sometimes disgusting twist in their songs, which is missing here.

            <p>The music video for "Mein Land" was filmed on 23 May 2011 at Sycamore Cove State Beach in Malibu, California. It was directed by Jonas Åkerlund and depicts band members in casual 1960s beach attire. It shows them having a party while words in Beach Boys-type font describe the beach party. Near the end of the video, it cuts to 2012 and shows the band performing at the same beach, but dressed up industrially with flames shooting from various things around the stage. During the stage performance, each band member has face paint similar to Brandon Lee in the film The Crow. The music video was released on 11 November 2011.</p>

Where are you going, where?
I'm going from East to South

Where are you going, where?
I'm going from South to West

Where are you going, where?
I'm going from North to West

As he comes running
With the flag in his hand
My Country, My Country

You’re here in my country
My Country, My Country

You’re here in my country
My country

Where are you going, where?
I go with me from North to East

Where are you going, where?
I go with me from East to West

Where are you going, where?
I go from country to country alone

And nothing and nobody
ever invites me to stay
My Country, My Country

You’re here in my country
My Country, My Country

You’re here in my country
My waves and my beach
Jaaaaaaaaaah

A voice from out of the light
falls down from heavens face
Tears the horizon in two
Wherever you go, there’s nothing left free

This is my land
This is my land
This is my land

My Country, My Country
You’re here in my country

My Country, My Country
You’re here in my country
My wave and my beach
My country

expelled (from), My Country
Banished (from), My Country
Forgotten, My Country
Nowhere can I stay
My country
